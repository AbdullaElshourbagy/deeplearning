# Data Preprocessing and Data Augmentation

Data preprocessing plays a very important in many deep 
learning algorithms. In practice, many methods
work best after the data has been normalized and whitened.
However, the exact parameters for data preprocessing are usually not immediately apparent unless one has much experience working with the algorithms. In this page, we hope to demystify some of the preprocessing methods and also provide tips 
(and a "standard pipeline") for preprocessing data.
