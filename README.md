### Introduction

This project aims to create a collection of Jupyter notebooks discussing important topics in Deep Learning.

### The tour sequence

- Linear Classifier
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Descent (No framework)
- Forward props & Back props
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Neural Net (No framework, only numpy)
   - vectors & tensors
   - Different neural net layers (dense, dropout, max-pooling layers)
- Data preprocessing (house price dataset, catvsdog, IMDB)
- K Mean Clustering
- CNN (Pytorch, TF, Keras) -> classify whales photos
- Callbacks (early stopping and etc)
- TF Dashboard
- Training model in the cloud
- Sentiment Analysis (binary classification)
- Sentiment analysis (multi-classification)
- Word2vec
- Hyperparamter Tuning
- Transfer Learning
- Generate song lyrics and stories
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Linear regression Kaggle competition using the above knowledge
- Bayes Classifier
- Gaussian Mixture Model
- VAE
- Generative Models
- GAN basic
- StarGAN
- CycleGAN
- Reinforcement learning

### Pre-requesties

- Basic Python Knowledge
- Some Machine Learning
- Basic idea about Deep Learning

### Installation

1. Anaconda

Anaconda is a package management platform Data Scientists that lets you easily manage and install dependencies in 
cross-platform manner. It also ships with *Jupyter Notebook*, which plays a critical role in order to contribute to this
project.

For more detail about why you should use Anaconda? https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-use-anaconda-instead-of-traditional-Python-distributions-for-data-science

Installation per platform:
- Windows: [Install Python on Windows (Anaconda)](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444)
- Mac: [Install Python on Mac (Anaconda)](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-mac-anaconda-ccd9f2014072)

2. Docker

Details will be added shortly


### How do you contribute?

1. Join the Discord channel [https://discord.gg/MAMPnmm](https://discord.gg/x6S6ce)
2. Goto _#request-to-join_ channel and post your Github Account name!
3. Once you are granted with access to the project, please create a git branch with your name
4. Complete each topic and challenge in order of number sequence
   - for example: 000-Linear-Classification -> 001-Linear-Regression
5. Reference existing code submissions from contributors or Wiki pages
6. I will post Jupyter Notebooks with sample code or challenges to complete
